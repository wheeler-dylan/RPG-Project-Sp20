#This class will act as the game state of a game station. 
#   "tabletop" refers to the game objects that are "in play",
#   and should be able to be refered to from anywhere in the program.
#
#   It will hold things like the players that are connected to 
#       the session and their characters, and any objects the 
#       Game Master (GM) wants to present to the players.
